<div align="center"><sup>(Shitty Python App I Made Entirely)</sup></div>

---

### Naming:
<br/>

<div align="center">It's a CLI app that is shitty, Pythonic, made by me, might just be the most perfect name.</div>

---

### Interface:
<br/>

> **Hey {name}, Whatcha wanna do?!**

That's what the app asks you, and then It goes on being the most boring thing to ever exist.

> **1: Repeat**

The f*ck?!
People reached the moon in 1969 and you're here doing shit like this:
```py
import os

inp = input('> ')
os.system('cls')
print(inp)
```
Very very amazing if i might say, c'est juste parfait.

### Commands & Placeholders:
Just do `.help`
I'm too lazy to make a new commands and placeholders menu, OK...

### Games
It's like games but worse.
