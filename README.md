### Interface:

> #### Hey {User}, Whatcha wanna do?!

That's what the app asks you, and then It goes on being the most boring thing to ever exist.

The f*ck?!
People reached the moon in 1969 and you're here doing:
```py
import os

inp = input('> ')
os.system('cls')
print(inp)
```
Very very amazing if i might say, c'est juste parfait.
Guys, It's evolving, just backwards...
